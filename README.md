## How to run

Make sure to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

Decrypt `.env.enc` file with the password you received (openssl required):

```bash
bash decrypt.sh
# enter pasword and hit enter
```

> [!TIP]
> If you did not receive the password or if you are experiencing troubles, feel free to call me at any time.

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Wait for every container to start up and then visit: http://localhost:3000
